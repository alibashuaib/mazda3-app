# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-05)

**Core value:** New and changed catalogue data arrives in the admin review queue automatically every month, and nothing is published without owner approval.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Reliable & Safe Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Reliable & Safe Foundation)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-11-05 - Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Photos not automated (owner generates with Codex); PHO-01/02 are v2.
- Autopilot writes only to `proposals`; only admin `apply_proposal` writes live tables.
- Mazda-only, 16 catalogue cars first; monthly cadence; hard cost cap.
- Plain `autopilot_jobs` table, not pgmq; two-call search then extract design.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 research flags: `anthropic-version` header, web_search quality for KSA, Edge Function limits.
- Phase 4: marketplace terms; prices likely from snippets and user observations only.
